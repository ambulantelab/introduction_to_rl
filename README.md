# RL From Scratch

This repository accompanies a reinforcement learning course focused on
implementing algorithms from first principles.

## Rules
- All algorithms must be implemented in `.py` files
- Notebooks are for visualization and analysis only
- External RL libraries are not permitted

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 9. Instructor Notes

- This repo is intentionally incomplete: students fill in algorithms
- Designed for pytest-based autograding
- Easily extensible to robotics (ROS2, real sensors)

**This repository is ready to be pushed directly to GitHub and used on Day 1.**
